## Tilt Test

On a losing streak? On tilt? Thinking of playing another game?

Make sure to use Tilt Test first.

Tilt Test uses the RIOT Games API to get match history for your past 5 games and determine whether or not that next game is really worth it, or if you're better off saving that LP.

TL;DR A web app I built to play around with the league of legends API

If you feel you could add some cool features to the website, or want to help take it further, just open a PR or create an issue and I'll look into it :)))
