## Tilt Test

On a losing streak? On tilt? Thinking of playing another game?

Make sure to use Tilt Test first.

Tilt Test uses the RIOT Games API to get match history for your past 5 games and determine whether or not that next game is really worth it, or if you're better off saving that LP.

TL;DR A web app I built to play around with the league of legends API
